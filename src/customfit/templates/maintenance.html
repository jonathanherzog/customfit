Note: the file you actually *want* to edit is in 
static/error-pages/site-maintenance.html.

Why? Heroku needs to redirect users to a static asset when we're in 
maintenance mode, and so the file needs to be static and copied to the
S3 bucket when it changes, so it just makes more sense to treat it as a 
static asset then a template.
