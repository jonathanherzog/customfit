<p>
	If you’d like to make Seamless Test Design in a mostly seamless way,
	here’s how:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cast on the total number of body stitches, front and back together:</strong>
</p>

	<p>
	CO 98 stitches,
	place side seam marker,
	CO 98,
	place round marker.
	196 stitches;
	join for working in the round, being careful not to twist. <strong><em>Note: You will be
	working flat once you reach the armhole shaping; change needle size if necessary to
	preserve gauge.</em></strong>
	</p>

<p>
	Work in hem stitch and then main pattern stitch, including waist shaping
	for front and back, as written in instructions above (but on all body
	stitches at once).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>When you reach armhole shaping</strong>, work back and forth on front and back
	stitches separately as written in the pattern.
</p>
<p>
	When body pieces are complete, seam shoulders using mattress stitch.
</p>

<p>
	Work any edge trim stitches as described in Finishing.
