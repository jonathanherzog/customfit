<p>
	If you’d like to make Seamless Test Design in a mostly seamless way,
	here’s how:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cast on the total number of body stitches, front and back together:</strong>
</p>

	<p>
		CO 47 stitches,
		place side seam marker,
		CO 98,
		place side seam marker,
		CO 47.
		192 stitches total.
	</p>

<p>
	Work in hem stitch and then main pattern stitch, including waist shaping
	for front and back, as written in instructions above (but on all body
	stitches at once).
</p>
<p>
	<strong>When you reach armhole shaping</strong>, work back and forth on front and back
	stitches separately as written in the pattern.
</p>
<p>
	When body pieces are complete, seam shoulders using mattress stitch.
</p>

	<p>
		<strong>Knit sleeves from the top down</strong> in the round as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
		With RS facing and beginning at top shoulder seam, pick up and
		knit 67 stitches around armhole edge.
		You will now shape the sleeve caps using short rows.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Set-up Row 1 (RS):</em> Knit 10
		stitches, wrap the next stitch, turn your work.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Set-up Row 2 (WS):</em>  Purl 21
		stitches, wrap the next stitch, turn your work.
	</p>
	<p>
		Continue working short rows as established, working one additional
		stitch each row and working wraps with wrapped stitches, until
		16 stitches remain unworked at armhole,
		ending with a WS row.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Next row (RS):</em> Knit across all stitches, joining for working in the
		round. You have shaped the sleeve cap and have
		67 stitches for sleeve.
	</p>
	<p>
		Work down the arm in the round, reversing shaping as described in the
		Sleeve section of pattern, until you reach the end of the sleeve.
		BO all stitches.
	</p>

<p>
	Work any edge trim stitches as described in Finishing.
