   <em>Trim Armholes:</em>
</p>

  <p>
    Beginning at underarm seam, pick up and knit 
    {{ piece.total_armhole_stitches | count_fmt }} sts
    around armhole with a circular needle. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Join for working in the round, being careful not to twist. Work even in 
    {{ pspec.armhole_edging_stitch_patterntext }} for 
    {{ pspec.armhole_edging_height | length_fmt }}, 
    then BO all sts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repeat for other armhole.
